## What are the key differences between this and Colonel_Mortis' Unofficial LTT Notifier?

Here are some of the differences:
* We've updated the TimeAgo plugin to the latest version (v1.5.2 to v1.6.3)
* We've updated to the latest version of FontAwesome (v4.2.0 to v5.6.0)
* We've updated to the latest version of jQuery (v2.2.1 to v3.3.1)
* This extension is compatible with Modern Web Browsers like FireFox 60+ and Chromium since it was re-designed for it. Mortis' extension is now EOL whilst this is supported
* This code has been designed from the ground up to be a lot easier to maintain in the future. Most functionality in the Javascript code is split up into a bunch of different files within a folder responsible for just what it needs to be responsible for.
