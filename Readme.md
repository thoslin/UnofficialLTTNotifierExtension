## What are the key differences between this and Colonel_Mortis' Unofficial LTT Notifier?

Here are some of the differences:
* We've updated the TimeAgo plugin to the latest version (from v1.5.2 to v1.6.3)
* We've updated to the latest version of FontAwesome (from v4.2.0 to v5.7.1)
* We've updated to the latest version of jQuery (from v2.2.1 to v3.3.1)
* We're using the latest version of Bootstrap (v4.2.1)

* This extension is compatible with Modern Web Browsers like FireFox 60+ and Chromium since it was re-designed for it. Mortis' extension is now EOL whilst this is supported.
* This code has been designed from the ground up to be a lot easier to maintain in the future. Most functionality in the Javascript code is split up into a bunch of different files within a folder responsible for a very clear purpose.

## TODO
* Getting data from LTT - Johny and AluminiumTech - Make sure not to scrape LTT more than every 30 seconds.Ideally every 60 seconds.
* Getting data from YouTube - AluminiumTech
* Getting data from Twitch - Johny/AluminiumTech
* Handle Extension updates properly - AluminiumTech

### Done
* Desktop notifications - Johny
